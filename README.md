A very simple Dictionary app for iPhone and iPad that uses built-in dictionary feature of iOS. It displays the same dictionary UI as you tap and hold your finger on the word and tap "Look Up" in the pop-up menu.

## Features

- Auto Layout that enables multiple screen sizes as well as Slide Over and Split View on iPad
- Dark Mode

## Note
As the [official developer document](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uireferencelibraryviewcontroller) mentioned, "A UIReferenceLibraryViewController object should not be used to display wordlists, create a standalone dictionary app, or republish the content in any form". Therefore, it is not recommended to submit this app directly to the App Store.
